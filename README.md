# APB-Protocol-Verification-using-System-Verilog-
APB bus verification testbench in SystemVerilog â€“ complete flow with random transaction generation and self-checking scoreboard.

This project implements a complete SystemVerilog verification environment for the AMBA APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol. It includes all the essential components of a modern testbench such as a transaction generator, driver (BFM), monitor, scoreboard, and DUT. The generator creates randomized APB transactions, the driver applies them to the DUT using APB protocol handshaking, and the monitor observes bus activity. The scoreboard maintains a reference memory model to perform self-checking verification by comparing expected and actual results. This environment demonstrates stimulus generation, protocol checking, and functional validation in a structured testbench setup. It is useful for students, beginners, and verification engineers who want to learn or showcase a working APB protocol verification flow in SystemVerilog.
